## Unittests and Integration Tests

### Unittests
- is the process of testing that a particular function returns expected results for different set of inputs.
- A unit test is supposed to test standard inputs and corner cases.

##### The goal of a unit test is to answer the question: if everything defined outside this function works as expected, does this function work as expected?

### Intergration tests
- Integration tests aim to test a code path end-to-end.

- In general, only low level functions that make external calls such as HTTP requests, file I/O, database I/O, etc. are mocked.
